# AdrenoToolsDrivers_termux

This project is an poc to use proprietary Adreno Vulkan driver blobs in termux
like libadrenotools for other apps

### Dependencies
```bash
pkg install clang cmake ninja vulkan-headers vulkan-tools libxcb libx11 xorgproto
```

### convert.sh

```bash
./convert.sh 805.zip
```

is creates an work and driver directory ~/.driver 

```bash
./convert.sh -c 
```
to cleanup Everything generated by the Script

1. Unpacks the provided driver ZIP file
2. Locates the primary Vulkan shared object
3. generates a wrapper to map Vulkan C symbols
4. Compile the wrapper and wsi layer (from [xMeM](https://github.com/xMeM/vulkan-wsi-layer))
5. Generates the vulkan icd json
6. Print GPU Info hopefully with the selected Driver, haha
  if not it dosnt work 

The driver blobs (like 805.zip) are from: [K11MCH1/AdrenoToolsDrivers](https://github.com/K11MCH1/AdrenoToolsDrivers)
The goal is to be able to use all drivers from there.

by now only the prop. drivers like 774, 805 etc working

akter install the driver you can run "test_driver.sh" like 

```bash
./test_driver.sh vkmark
```

note, need for most vulkan programms (vkmark works without haha..)

```bash
$HOME/.local/share/vulkan/implicit_layer.d
````

this may break turnip driver installs but after "convert.sh -c" should just work again, if you use your system driver it will also use the wsi wrappper..

use at your own risk, iam just trying

will make an Performance chart in some time, 
Redmagic 8s pro, sd8gen2 adreno 740 over here, so i can only confirm this SoC now
